 * Polymorphism:

	Polymorphism makes it possible to use the same entity in different forms. In Java, this means that you can declare 
	several methods with the same name until they are different in certain characteristics. Java provides us with two 
	ways to implement polymorphism: method overloading and method overriding.
	
	* Static polymorphism: Method overloading
	
	Method overloading means that you can have several methods with the same name within a class. 
	However, the number, names, or types of their parameters need to be different.
	For example, the Bird() class below has three fly() methods. The first one doesnâ€™t have any parameters, 
	the second one has one parameter (height), and the third one has two parameters (name and height).
 */

class Bird {
	public void fly() {
		System.out.println("The bird is flying.");
	}

	public void fly(int height) { 
		System.out.println("The bird is flying " + height + " feet high.");
	}

	public void fly(String name, int height) { // here indicate PARAMETERS
		System.out.println("The " + name + " is flying " + height + " feet high.");
	}
}

public class StaticPolymorphism_MethodOverloading {
	// The test class instantiates a new Bird object and calls the fly() method
	// three times. Firstly, without parameters, secondly, with one integer
	// parameter for height, and thirdly, with two parameters for name and height.
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Bird myBird = new Bird();

		myBird.fly();
		myBird.fly(10000);
		myBird.fly("eagle", 10000); // here, we indicate ARGUMENTS
