	 * Object: is a bundle of data and its behaviour(often known as methods).
	 * 
	 * Objects have two characteristics: They have states (Fields) and behaviors (Methods).
	 * 
	 * Examples of states and behaviors Example 1: Object: House State: Address,
	 * Color, Area Behavior: Open door, close door
	 * 
	 * So if I had to write a class based on states and behaviors of House. I can
	 * do it like this: States can be represented as instance variables and
	 * Behaviors as methods of the class. We will see how to create classes in the
	 * next section of this guide.
	 * 
	 * class House { 
	 * String address; 
	 * String color; 
	 * double are; 
	 * void openDoor() 
	 * 	{//Write code here } 
	 * void closeDoor() 
	 * 	{ //Write code here } ... ... 
	 * }
	 *

		A Car IS-A Vehicle and HAS-A License then the code would look like this:
		
		public class Vehicle{ }
